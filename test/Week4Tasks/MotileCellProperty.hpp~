 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * This tutorial assumes you have already read [wiki:UserTutorials/CreatingAndUsingANewForce].
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * In the  [wiki:UserTutorials/CreatingAndUsingANewCellMutationState] we showed how to create a new cell mutation
 * state class, and how this can be used in a cell-based simulation. As well as
 * mutation states, cells may be given much more general properties, using the cell
 * property class hierarchy. In this tutorial, we show how to create a new cell property
 * class, and how this can be used in a cell-based simulation. We will also use a simple
 * new force to illustrate what you can do with cell properties (and also mutations).
 *
 * == 1. Including header files ==
 *
 * As in previous cell-based Chaste tutorials, we begin by including the necessary
 * header file and archiving headers.
