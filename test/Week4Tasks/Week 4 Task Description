CHASTE: Fourth exercise descpription --------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We have entered the final stages of this project. Everything is up and running to the exact specifications required. Only a 
few tasks remain. All that remains is to fit a parabollic PDE with the correct sources on the siumulation and finally 
implement a working CellMutationStatesCountWriter. We wish to finish this by Thursday ready for presentation on Friday. 
Also don't forget about that damn poster for this project. 

3 Tasks were assigned for this simulation:

    1. Apply a proper Parabollic PDE which only uses Labelled T Cells as sources.  
    
    2. Alter Chemotaxic force files supplied by James for simulation. We wish for unlabelled T Cells to follow the concentration gradient
    
    3. Fix CellMutationStateWriter to output counts for the correct mutation states instead of the default set
    
    4. Increase domain radius to 10
