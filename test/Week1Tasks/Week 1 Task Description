CHASTE: First exercise descpription ---------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this exercise was to learn how to design, run and add new functionality to
basic node-based simulations. 


The simulation began with growing a simple blob of cells at the origin.

3 Tasks were assigned for this simulation:

    0. Get a working base for growing a simple blob of cells

    1. Write a CellKiller that will kill cells outside region of a disk with radius 5
    
    2. Randomly divide the cell population into Group A and Group B
        a. Group A cells die outside the region of a disc of radius 5
        b. Group B cells die outside the region of an annulus with inner 
            radius 2 and outer radius 7
    
    3. Write a new CellCycleModel such that:
        a. Group A cells divide accorrding to a U[11, 13] distribution
        b. Broup B cells divide according to an E[1/12] distribution
