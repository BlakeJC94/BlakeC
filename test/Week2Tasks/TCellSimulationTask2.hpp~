/* The purpose of this exercise was to begin the foundation of T-cell simulation for later integration
 * into the final model. Only the labelled T-cells will be focussed on here, no tumor growth. We 
 * assert that these cells dont divide, dont die and experience repulsion forces between each other. 
 * We treat the simulation area as a square box with side length 10 centered at the origin. */

/* Task 2: Write a SimulationModifer that moves cells that leave the box boundaries. 
 *      That is,Once a cell arrives at x,y = +-5, set x,y = -+5 */
