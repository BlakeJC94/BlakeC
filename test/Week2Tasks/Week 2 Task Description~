CHASTE: Second exercise descpription --------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this exercise was to begin the foundation of T-cell simulation for later integration
into the final model. Only the labelled T-cells will be focussed on here, no tumor growth. We 
assert that these cells dont divide, dont die and experience repulsion forces between each other. 
We treat the simulation area as a square box with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The simulation began with randomly spawning 100 cells throughout the box using code provided from
Kidney cell simulations provided by James Osborne.

4 Tasks were assigned for this simulation:

    0. Get a working base that randomly spawns the T cells throughout the box

    1. Write a CellForce that moves the cells from right to left
        a. Implement a diffusion force and repulsion force for more random movement
    
    2. Write a SimulationModifer that moves cells that leave the box boundaries. 
        That is, once a cell arrives at x,y = +-5, set x,y = -+5
    
    3. Couple T-cell simulation with a tumor growth simulation
    
    4. Revise CellForce and CellCycle for the added tumor cells
    
    5. Writing a contact-based CellKiller
        (Using some code from Delta-NotchTrackingModifer to analyse neighbouring cells)
