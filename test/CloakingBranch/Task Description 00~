CHASTE: Exercise descpription 00 --------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuing from where we left off with the Vacation Scholars project, we met with Fede and 
discussed the next steps foward to making this project worthy of publication. We don't want to 
replicate what fede has done with his original model, but we want to add to it.

We want to write a detailed study of different methods of comutation and modelling. This will 
involve branching off the model currently and scaling up to the order of 500 cells instead of
20 or so. The first branch will be incorperating a 'cloaking' behaviour of the tumor cells by 
modifying the existing PDE to make the attacked tumor cells act as 'sinks'. The second branch 
will be adding a recrietment process for the attacking T Cells by modifying the CellCycleModel. 


2 Tasks were assigned for this simulation:

    01. Modify the PDE to get the attacked tumor cells to 'mop up' cytokines (cloaking model) 
        (Or add another pde and use competing forces for cloaking model?)

    02. Alter the CellCycleModel to make a more accurate 'recreitment process'
