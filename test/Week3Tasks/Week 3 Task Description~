CHASTE: Third exercise descpription ---------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

After Week 2, we have a basic, but working first iteration of the simulation we are
working towards. This week, we wish to add more foundations for more adding more
complexity in later revisions. This will require rewriting some components to be 
more flexiblew with cell counts and a more sophisticted CellCycleModel for T Cells
as well as a new label to protect the primary T Cell spawner. 


4 Tasks were assigned for this simulation:

    0. Re-write components to act on CellLabels rather than cell counts

    1. Write new CellProperties "TCell" and "ImTCell" and make working 
        domain circular with radius of 5 units using boundary conditions
    
    2. Write a new CellCycleModel to make the stem cell ImTCell the 
        primary spawn point for T Cells and write a circular CellKiller 
    
    3. Fix CellCycleModel to stop the new T Cells dividing once spawned
