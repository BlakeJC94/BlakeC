CHASTE: Third exercise descpription ---------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

After Week 2, we have a basic, but working first iteration of the simulation we are
working towards. This week, we wish to add more foundations for more adding more
complexity in later revisions. This will require rewriting some components to be 
more flexiblew with cell counts and a more sophisticted CellCycleModel for T Cells
as well as a new label to protect the primary T Cell spawner. 


4 Tasks were assigned for this simulation:

    0. Re-write components to act on CellLabels rather than cell counts

    1. Write new CellProperties "TCell" and "ImTCell" and make working 
        domain circular with radius of 5 units using boundary conditions
    
    2. Write a new CellCycleModel to make the stem cell ImTCell the 
        primary spawn point for T Cells and write a circular CellKiller 
    
    3. Fix CellCycleModel to stop the new T Cells dividing once spawned
    
    4. Overhaul simulation management:
        a. Change CellProperties into CellMutationStates and modify component targeting 
            parameters to check mutation states, not properties. 
        b. Remove All mentions of CellProperties (and CellLabels temporarily).
        c. Fix CellProliferativeStates and CellCycleModel to line up simulation code with 
            correct biological semantics. Specify the max no. of generations to tumor cells. 
                Tumor Cells --> Transit / Tumor MutationState
                T Cells --> Differntiated / TCell MutationState
                Node0 --> Stem / TCell MutationState
        d. Change node0 targeting in components to be independent of node index
    
    5. Use CellLabel to mark T-Cells that are attatched to tumor cells, set up 
        framework for an updated time-based CellKiller
    
    6. Use EllipticPDES components in ChasteSVN Repo to overlay PDE in simulation
    
In future revision we will focus on Making cells react to the overlayed PDE. 
Ideally we wil make T-Cells that attach to Tumor cells into source terms. This will 
occur with some probabilty. Otherwise mutual cell annihilation will occur instead.
