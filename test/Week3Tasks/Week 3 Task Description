CHASTE: Third exercise descpription ---------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

After Week 2, we have a basic, but working first iteration of the simulation we are
working towards. This week, we wish to add more foundations for more adding more
complexity in later revisions. This will require rewriting some components to be 
more flexiblew with cell counts and a more sophisticted CellCycleModel for T Cells
as well as a new label to protect the primary T Cell spawner. 


4 Tasks were assigned for this simulation:

    0. Re-write components to act on CellLabels rather than cell counts

    1. Write new CellProperties "TCell" and "ImTCell"
    
    2. Write a new CellCycleModel to make the stem cell ImTCell the 
        primary spawn point for T Cells
        a. Make new TCells differntiated and remove the ImTCell Property
    
    3. Make working domain circular with radius of 5 units and write a 
        new circular CellKiller which only acts on T Cells (not ImTcell!)
    
    4. Write modifier to move spawned T Cells to edge of circular domain
